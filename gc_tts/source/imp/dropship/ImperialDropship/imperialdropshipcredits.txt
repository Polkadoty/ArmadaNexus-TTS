If you use this, you must credit me, Lokgroa.

This is the Imperial Dropship from The Mandalorian converted from the Galaxy of Heroes game.

I've included a flyable ship version and a open door prop model version.

I've edited the camera angles and speed to match the show and work in game, if it isn't what you want, you can change it.
I think I included everything to get it in game but if not the ship stuff is using the stock Tie Fighter and troop transport odfs.
